  summary: Building responsible AI with proper governance, risk management, and ethics frameworks
  yirifi_anchor: 'Three permission modes: AI does everything automatically, AI only uses approved tools, AI asks for every
    action. Different contexts need different trust levels. The question isn''t ''can AI do this?'' but ''should AI do this
    unsupervised?'' Document your answer. You''ll be asked.'
  external_examples:
  - Microsoft's responsible AI framework (principles into practice, not just principles)
  - OpenAI's safety practices (constitutional AI, RLHF, red teaming—operational, not theoretical)
