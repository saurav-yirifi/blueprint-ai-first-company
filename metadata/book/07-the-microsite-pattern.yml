  summary: Domain microsites with shared infrastructure and AI agent access—the pattern that enables rapid scaling
  yirifi_anchor: Each domain—DevOps, QA, Data, Marketing, Sales, Finance—owns their own microsite end-to-end. Same architecture,
    different domain logic. When AI capabilities evolve, we add a new module. No rewiring required.
  external_examples:
  - Shopify's modular architecture (teams own surfaces, platform owns infrastructure)
  - GitLab's service decomposition (monolith to modular over years, strangler fig pattern)
  key_concepts:
  - Build vs Buy Calculus
  - MCP
  - Agent Hub
