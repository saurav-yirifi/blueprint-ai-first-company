  summary: How to build AI-first architecture that absorbs change rather than resisting it, with a focus on modularity, emerging
    technologies, and the principles that will guide AI-first companies into the future.
  yirifi_anchor: Each service is its own module. When AI capabilities evolve—and they will, faster than any of us expect—we
    add a new module. No rewiring required. The architecture that works today is designed to absorb the capabilities of tomorrow.
