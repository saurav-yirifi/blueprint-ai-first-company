  summary: How to build software with AI as a collaborator—tools, patterns, and workflows
  yirifi_anchor: 'Those 15 backoffice microsites? Built by just 2 people with AI coding as the default mode. But ''AI built
    it'' doesn''t mean ''no human thinking.'' The pattern: AI drafts, human architects, AI refines, human reviews. The team
    stayed at 2 because each person operated at 5x—not by working harder, but by thinking while AI typed.'
