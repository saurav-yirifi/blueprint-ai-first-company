  summary: Navigating foundation models, providers, aggregators, and making strategic choices
  yirifi_anchor: We don't commit to one provider. Our AI Tool Gateway routes requests based on task type, cost constraints,
    and availability. Model routing isn't a nice-to-have—it's how you avoid vendor lock-in while getting the right model for
    each job.
  external_examples:
  - Perplexity's multi-model orchestration (different models for search vs synthesis)
  - Replit's model selection framework (Claude for code, GPT for natural language, specialized models for specific tasks)
  key_concepts:
  - Build vs Buy Calculus
