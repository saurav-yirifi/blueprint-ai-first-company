  summary: Structuring teams and building culture for AI-first success
  yirifi_anchor: 'Just 2 people, 15 backoffice microsites. But those 2 people aren''t doing 2 jobs each—they''re architecting
    while AI builds. The skill that matters: knowing what to ask AI to do, and recognizing when AI got it wrong. That''s not
    a new role. It''s every role, upgraded.'
