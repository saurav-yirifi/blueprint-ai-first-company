  summary: The infrastructure stack for AI-first companies—databases, gateways, and auth
  yirifi_anchor: 'Three tiers of AI access: reading system status is free, production deploys require approval, and deleting
    user data is always human-only. The tiers aren''t about limiting AI—they''re about matching autonomy to reversibility.'
  external_examples:
  - Linear's infrastructure decisions (minimal, opinionated stack)
  - Raycast's AI architecture (local-first with cloud fallback)
  key_concepts:
  - Build vs Buy Calculus
