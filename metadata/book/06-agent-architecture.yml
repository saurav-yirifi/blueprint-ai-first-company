  summary: Two types of agents, when to use each, and the Agent Hub pattern
  yirifi_anchor: 'Two agent types by design: chat agents that talk to people, background agents that run while everyone sleeps.
    The DevOps dashboard doesn''t just serve humans—agents query it for system health, deployment status, incident context.
    Same API, both consumers.'
  external_examples:
  - Intercom's Fin architecture (chat agent with human handoff)
  - Klarna's AI assistant (handled 2.3M conversations in first month—background agents feeding chat agents)
  key_concepts:
  - Probabilistic AI
  - Human-AI Collaboration
