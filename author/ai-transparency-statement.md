# AI Transparency Statement

## Context

This book was written with extensive use of AI tools, specifically Claude (Anthropic). Publishing standards (Elsevier, Sage, Wiley) prohibit listing AI as a co-author, but encourage transparent disclosure. This follows the approach praised when author Reid Southen published an AI transparency statement -- building trust rather than undermining it.

For a book about building AI-first companies, transparent AI use is a feature, not a bug.

## Draft Statement (for Foreword)

"Let me be transparent about how this book was made. I used Claude (Anthropic's AI) extensively throughout the writing process -- for drafting, structuring arguments, refining examples, and editing. The ideas, frameworks, and 20+ years of banking experience are mine. The efficient transformation of those ideas into coherent prose? That was a human-AI collaboration.

If you're going to build an AI-first company, you need to actually use AI first. This book is proof of concept."

## Draft Statement (for Acknowledgments)

"Claude (Anthropic) was used for drafting, editing, and content refinement throughout this manuscript."
