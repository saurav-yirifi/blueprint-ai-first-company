# Templates

Fill-in-the-blank templates adapted from the actual files used to write *Blueprint for An AI-First Company*. These aren't theoretical -- they're the production system with the specifics stripped out and replaced with `[BRACKETED]` placeholders.

The real voice system had 6 files. The real prompt library had 27 prompts. The real skill system had 14 agents. These templates give you the structural starting points for each.

## How to Use

1. **Copy the template** to your project
2. **Replace `[BRACKETED]` placeholders** with your content
3. **Delete sections that don't apply** -- not every book needs every piece
4. **Iterate** -- these evolved over 3 drafts and 81,000 words; yours will too

Start with voice system templates. Everything else builds on your voice being encoded.

## Recommended Order

| Step | Template | Why First |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | [Gold Standard Reference](voice-system/gold-standard-template.md) | Find your benchmark -- everything measures against this |
| 2 | [Voice Guide](voice-system/voice-guide-template.md) | Encode your voice DNA from the gold standard analysis |
| 3 | [Audience Empathy](voice-system/audience-empathy-template.md) | Define who you're writing for -- voice without audience is noise |
| 4 | [Authenticity Markers](voice-system/authenticity-markers-template.md) | Catalog phrases to use and kill-list phrases to avoid |
| 5 | [Master System Prompt](prompts/master-system-prompt-template.md) | Combine voice + audience into a single AI instruction set |
| 6 | [Section Writing](prompts/section-writing-template.md) | The prompt that generates actual manuscript content |
| 7 | [Editing](prompts/editing-prompt-template.md) | Post-draft refinement prompts |
| 8 | [Review](prompts/review-prompt-template.md) | Quality assessment against your standards |

## What These Are Not

These templates encode *structure*, not *content*. They won't tell you what to write about AI strategy or startup operations. They'll give you the system for teaching an AI to write like you, about whatever your book covers.

The value isn't in the placeholders -- it's in the relationships between the files. The gold standard feeds the voice guide, which feeds the master prompt, which feeds every writing and editing session. Break that chain and the outputs drift.
