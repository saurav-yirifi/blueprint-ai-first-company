This isn't a collection of slides repackaged as markdown. Every framework comes from building real products -- digital banks that acquired 450,000 clients in four months, an AI startup where two people shipped 15 products in three months, and a $5 billion retail operation spanning 32 countries. The book was written using the same AI-first methods it teaches, and the entire production system is documented here.

## The AI Writing System

> **81,000 words. 775 citations. 14 AI agents. The entire system is documented.**

This book was produced using a multi-agent AI writing system built on Claude Code, Perplexity, and Obsidian. The full system -- every prompt, script, skill, and architectural decision -- is open for you to study, adapt, or use.

What's documented: author voice encoding (6 files that teach an LLM to write like a specific human), 27 modular prompts across 5 categories, multi-agent orchestration, a research pipeline that generates citation-ready content, Obsidian vault architecture, a Flask + PostgreSQL analysis app with 70+ modules, and a 4-phase editorial review process.

## About the Author

**Saurav Bhatia** is the Founder and CEO of [Yirifi.ai](https://yirifi.ai), where his two-person team built 15 AI-powered microsites in three months -- a proof point for what AI-first development makes possible, and the central case study of this book.

Before Yirifi, Saurav spent nearly a decade at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore and Hong Kong. As Interim CEO and Chief Customer & Product Officer of **TRUST Bank** -- Singapore's first digital bank -- he laid the foundation from scratch: regulatory approval, joint venture with NTUC, 100+ person team, and a product that acquired 450,000 clients within four months, capturing 9% market share. As founding CFO of **Mox Bank** in Hong Kong, he helped secure the virtual banking license and build what became the most downloaded app in Hong Kong across all categories -- 440,000 clients and $1.2 billion in deposits within two years.

He also served as Global Head of Digital Assets for Retail, Private and Wealth at Standard Chartered, and Global Head of Finance for the bank's $5 billion retail operation spanning 9 million clients in 32 countries. Before Standard Chartered, he held progressive leadership roles at Citibank over nine years.

Saurav holds an MBA from the National University of Singapore and completed the Oxford Blockchain Strategy Programme. He began his career as a founder in 1999.
