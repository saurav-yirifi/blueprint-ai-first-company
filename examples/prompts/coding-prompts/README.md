# Coding Prompts

> Ready-to-use prompt templates for AI-assisted development, organized around the [8 Patterns for Effective AI Coding](../../../book/part-2-building/05-building-with-ai/04-the-8-patterns-for-effective-ai-coding.md) from Chapter 5.

## Prompts in This Collection

| Prompt File | Patterns Covered | Use When... |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| [Context Loading](context-loading.md) | Pattern 1: Context First | Starting a new coding session or onboarding AI to your project |
| [Test-Driven Prompts](test-driven-prompts.md) | Pattern 5: Test-Driven Prompting | Writing tests before implementation or defining behavior specs |
| [Architecture Prompts](architecture-prompts.md) | Pattern 4: Architecture Ownership | Making structural decisions before handing implementation to AI |
| [Review Prompts](review-prompts.md) | Pattern 8: Review Ruthlessly | Reviewing AI-generated code for correctness, security, and style |
| [Error Escalation Prompts](error-escalation-prompts.md) | Pattern 6: Error Escalation | Debugging failures with AI assistance using a structured ladder |

## How to Use These Prompts

Each file contains 3-5 prompt templates. Every template includes:

- **The prompt itself** -- copy-paste ready, with placeholders marked in `{BRACKETS}`
- **When to use it** -- the situation where this prompt produces the best results
- **Which pattern it applies** -- connection back to the 8 Patterns framework
- **Tips** -- practical advice for getting the most from the prompt

Replace placeholders with your specific project details before using. The prompts are designed to be adapted, not used verbatim -- your project context matters more than the template.

## The 8 Patterns Quick Reference

| # | Pattern | Principle |
|---|---------|-----------|
| 1 | Context First | Background before code |
| 2 | Concrete Examples | Show, don't tell |
| 3 | Iterative Refinement | Small focused requests |
| 4 | Architecture Ownership | You decide structure |
| 5 | Test-Driven Prompting | Behavior, not implementation |
| 6 | Error Escalation | Let AI fix before taking over |
| 7 | Checkpoint Commits | Protect working state |
| 8 | Review Ruthlessly | Trust but verify |
